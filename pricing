### **AWS S3 Storage Tiers - Monthly Costs**

#### **1. S3 Standard (Frequent Access)**
- **Storage Cost**: $6,390/month
  - First 50 TB: 50 × 1,024 GB × $0.023 = $1,177
  - Next 250 TB: 250 × 1,024 GB × $0.022 = $5,632
  - Total: $6,809/month

#### **2. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)**
- **Storage Cost**: $3,840/month
  - 300 TB × 1,024 GB × $0.0125 = $3,840
- **Note**: Additional retrieval fees apply when accessing data

#### **3. S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access**
- **Storage Cost**: $3,072/month
  - 300 TB × 1,024 GB × $0.01 = $3,072
- **Note**: Data stored in single availability zone (lower redundancy)

#### **4. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**
- **Storage Cost**: $1,229/month
  - 300 TB × 1,024 GB × $0.004 = $1,229
- **Retrieval**: Millisecond access with retrieval fees
- **Minimum storage**: 90 days

#### **5. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
- **Storage Cost**: $1,106/month
  - 300 TB × 1,024 GB × $0.0036 = $1,106
- **Retrieval time**: Minutes to hours
- **Minimum storage**: 90 days

#### **6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (Lowest Cost)**
- **Storage Cost**: $304/month
  - 300 TB × 1,024 GB × $0.00099 = $304
- **Retrieval time**: 12-48 hours
- **Minimum storage**: 180 days
- **Best for**: Long-term archival, compliance data

### **Initial Upload Costs**

Data uploads to AWS S3 are free - there are no data transfer charges for uploading data into S3. However, you will incur **PUT request costs**:

- **PUT Request Cost**: ~$15-$25
  - Cost: $0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests
  - Actual cost depends on file size and number of objects
  - Example: If uploading in 100 MB chunks = ~3.1M requests = $15.50

**Note**: Using multipart uploads with smaller chunk sizes increases costs significantly - with 1 MB files, upload costs could reach $52.43/TB

---

### **Cost Comparison Summary**

| Storage Tier | Monthly Cost (300 TB) | Best Use Case |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **S3 Standard** | $6,809 | Frequently accessed data |
| **S3 Standard-IA** | $3,840 | Monthly access patterns |
| **S3 One Zone-IA** | $3,072 | Non-critical infrequent data |
| **S3 Glacier Instant** | $1,229 | Quarterly access, instant retrieval |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible** | $1,106 | Rare access, flexible timing |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | $304 | Long-term archival (7-10 years) |

---

### **Additional Considerations**

**Hidden Costs to Watch:**
1. **Data retrieval fees** - Apply to all Glacier and IA tiers when accessing data
2. **Request costs** - GET, LIST, DELETE operations (typically $0.0004-$0.005 per 1,000 requests)
3. **Data transfer out** - $0.09/GB for first 10 TB downloaded to internet
4. **Early deletion fees** - If data deleted before minimum storage duration
5. **Metadata overhead** - Glacier tiers charge 40 KB of metadata per object (8 KB at Standard rates, 32 KB at Glacier rates)

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use larger file sizes to minimize per-object overhead costs
- Implement lifecycle policies to automatically transition data between tiers
- Consider S3 Intelligent-Tiering for unpredictable access patterns
- Compress data before upload to reduce storage volume

The most cost-effective tier depends entirely on your access patterns. For true long-term archival that's rarely accessed, **Glacier Deep Archive at $304/month represents a 96% savings** compared to Standard storage at $6,809/month.

I'll search for current pricing on container hosting options for running your IT asset management application.Perfect! Now I have enough information to provide comprehensive estimates. Let me compile the container hosting options.

## Docker Container Hosting Cost Estimates (24/7/365)

Based on your requirements: **2-4 vCPUs, 4-8 GB RAM, 50-60 GB storage, persistent storage support**

---

### **Option 1: AWS ECS with Fargate (Serverless)**

**Configuration: 4 vCPUs + 8 GB RAM**

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
- **CPU**: 4 vCPUs × $0.04048/vCPU-hour × 730 hours = $118.20
- **Memory**: 8 GB × $0.004445/GB-hour × 730 hours = $25.95
- **Storage (EFS for persistence)**: ~$15/month for 50 GB
  - EFS Standard: $0.30/GB-month × 50 GB = $15

**Total: ~$159/month**

**Configuration: 2 vCPUs + 4 GB RAM** (smaller option)
- CPU: 2 × $0.04048 × 730 = $59.10
- Memory: 4 × $0.004445 × 730 = $12.98
- Storage (EFS): $15
**Total: ~$87/month**

**Pros:**
- No server management
- Automatic scaling capability
- Pay only for what you use (though running 24/7 removes this advantage)

**Cons:**
- More expensive than EC2 - Fargate charges approximately 16-40% premium over equivalent EC2 instances
- Limited to AWS EFS for persistent storage

---

### **Option 2: AWS EC2 Instance (Traditional VM with Docker)**

**Configuration: t3.medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM)**

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
- **Instance**: $0.04/hour × 730 hours = $30.37/month
- **EBS Storage**: 60 GB gp3 SSD = $4.80 (at $0.08/GB-month)
- **Data Transfer**: Minimal for IT asset management

**Total: ~$35/month**

**Configuration: t3.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM)** - if you need more RAM
- Instance: ~$60/month
- Storage: $4.80
**Total: ~$65/month**

**Pros:**
- **Most cost-effective for 24/7 workloads**
- Full control over the instance
- Easy persistent storage with EBS volumes
- Can use Docker Compose or similar tools

**Cons:**
- You manage the OS and Docker runtime
- No automatic scaling without additional setup

---

### **Option 3: Google Cloud Run (Serverless)**

**Configuration: 2 vCPUs + 4 GB RAM (24/7)**

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
- **CPU**: 2 vCPUs × $0.00002400/vCPU-second × 2,592,000 seconds = $124.42
- **Memory**: 4 GB × $0.00000250/GB-second × 2,592,000 seconds = $25.92
- **Requests**: Minimal for internal IT app (within free tier)
- **Storage**: Need Cloud Storage or persistent disk (~$5-10/month for 50 GB)

**Total: ~$155-160/month**

**Note:** Cloud Run free tier includes 180,000 vCPU-seconds (50 hours) and 360,000 GiB-seconds (100 hours for 1 GB container), plus 2 million requests free per month - but running 24/7 far exceeds this.

**Pros:**
- Automatic scaling
- Easy deployment
- Scales to zero when idle (though not helpful for 24/7)

**Cons:**
- **Expensive for always-on workloads**
- Persistent storage requires additional services
- Not ideal for 24/7 applications

---

### **Option 4: AWS Fargate Spot (Discounted, Interruptible)**

**Configuration: 4 vCPUs + 8 GB RAM**

Fargate Spot can save up to 70% compared to regular Fargate pricing

**Estimated Monthly Cost:**
- Regular Fargate: $159/month
- With 70% discount: ~$48-80/month (varies by availability)

**Pros:**
- Significant cost savings
- No server management

**Cons:**
- **Can be interrupted with 2-minute warning**
- Not suitable for critical IT asset management unless you can handle downtime
- Availability not guaranteed

---

## **Cost Comparison Summary**

| Option | Configuration | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **EC2 t3.medium** | 2 vCPU, 4 GB | **$35** | **Most cost-effective 24/7** |
| **EC2 t3.large** | 2 vCPU, 8 GB | **$65** | More RAM, still cost-effective |
| **Fargate (small)** | 2 vCPU, 4 GB | $87 | No server management |
| **Fargate (medium)** | 4 vCPU, 8 GB | $159 | Higher specs, serverless |
| **Cloud Run** | 2 vCPU, 4 GB | $155 | GCP preference |
| **Fargate Spot** | 4 vCPU, 8 GB | $48-80 | Can tolerate interruptions |

---

## **Recommendation**

For a 24/7 IT asset management application with persistence requirements:

**Best Value: AWS EC2 t3.medium ($35/month)**
- Runs Docker containers perfectly
- EBS volumes provide reliable persistent storage
- Most economical for always-on workloads
- Simple setup: install Docker, run your container, attach EBS volume
- Can use Docker Compose for easy management

**If you prefer serverless:** AWS Fargate at $87-159/month (depending on specs) removes infrastructure management but costs 2.5-4.5x more than EC2.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Add AWS Backup for EBS snapshots (~$2-3/month)
- Consider Reserved Instances for EC2 (1-year commitment saves ~30%, 3-year saves ~60%)
- T3 instances include "burstable" CPU with baseline performance - perfect for IT asset management workloads
